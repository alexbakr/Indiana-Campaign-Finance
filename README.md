# Indiana Campaign Fincance

### About

The campaign finance database contains detailed financial records that campaigns and committees are required by law to disclose. Through this database, you can view contribution and expense records from candidate, PAC, regular party, legislative caucus, and exploratory committees.

### What does the data contain

By Indiana law, candidates and committees are required to disclose detailed financial records of contributions received and expenditures made and debts owed by or to the committee. For committees, the campaign finance database contains all contributions, expenditures, and debts reported to the Election Division since January 1, 1998. 

### Records Included


- **Candidates for statewide office**, i.e., Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Auditor of State, Treasurer of State, and Clerk of the Supreme Court.

-  **Candidates for state legislative office**, i.e., STATE Senate and STATE House of Representatives.

- **Legislative Caucus Committees**, i.e., those organizations which are organized by members of the General Assembly of the same party, with the purpose to influence only the election of candidates for legislative office, and which accepts contributions or makes expenditures that exceed $100 during a calendar year to influence only the elections of candidates for legislative office (IC 3-5-2-27.3)

- **Political Action Committees (PACs)**, i.e., an organization located within or outside Indiana which is not an auxiliary party organization, a legislative caucus committee, a regular party committee, or a candidate's committee, and is not affiliated with a political party or a candidate's committee, and which accepts contributions or makes expenditures of more than $100 per calendar year for the purpose of aiding in the election or defeat of a candidate or a group of candidates for state, legislative, local, or school board office, or the outcome of a public question that will appear on the ballot in Indiana. (IC 3-5-2-37.)

- **Regular Party Committee**, i.e., a central committee or a national party committee of a political party. A regular party committee includes state committees, congressional district committees, county committees, and city and town committees of a political party (IC 3-5-2-42; 3-5-2-8.)

- **Candidate Exploratory Committee**, i.e., committees whose candidate otherwise fits the definition of a candidate committee but where the candidate has not decided to run for a particular office (IC 3-5-2-7.)

### When are the records available?	 

Campaign finance reports are posted to the database as they are received from the candidates and committees. Our data is as current as possible, consistent with the reporting requirements of Indiana law. Candidates and committees that file paper reports only will have reports available on-line in approximately 7 days following the pre-primary and pre-election report and 14 days after the annual report. Candidates and committees that file reports electronically will have reports available on-line at the same time as the paper reports.
